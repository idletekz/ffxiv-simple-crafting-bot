# ffxiv-simple-crafting-bot

A simple crafting bot for FFXIV based on AutoIT.

The bot allows you to craft the same item using one or more macros. Bot can start craft and press macro buttons over and over being in background.

Usage:

1. Prepare macros, put them on a hotbar with keybindings.
2. Make local config.ini and set proper timings and keys for your macros. Bot macro timing = sum of command timings in macro + some delay (2-3 seconds). Set time or item limit numbers as well. Time limit = food limit. Item limit = number of items you can craft.
3. Prepare mats, use food if needed.
4. Open crafting window, choose the desired item and all the materials (in case you want to use HQ). Make sure that NumLock is enabled and pressing Num 0 key will put cursor on a synthesize button.
5. Start bot.
